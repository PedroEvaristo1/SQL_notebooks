{"cells":[{"source":"**Author:** Pedro Evaristo de Oliveira - 20/10/2025\n\nGoodThought NGO has been a catalyst for positive change, focusing its efforts on education, healthcare, and sustainable development to make a significant difference in communities worldwide. With this mission, GoodThought has orchestrated an array of assignments aimed at uplifting underprivileged populations and fostering long-term growth.\n\nThis project offers a hands-on opportunity to explore how data-driven insights can direct and enhance these humanitarian efforts. In this project, you'll engage with the GoodThought PostgreSQL database, which encapsulates detailed records of assignments, funding, impacts, and donor activities from 2010 to 2023. This comprehensive dataset includes:\n\n- **`Assignments`:** Details about each project, including its name, duration (start and end dates), budget, geographical region, and the impact score.\n- **`Donations`:** Records of financial contributions, linked to specific donors and assignments, highlighting how financial support is allocated and utilized.\n- **`Donors`:** Information on individuals and organizations that fund GoodThoughtâ€™s projects, including donor types.\n\n\n**Query 1:** List the top five assignments based on total value of donations, categorized by donor type. The output should include four columns: 1) assignment_name, 2) region, 3) rounded_total_donation_amount rounded to two decimal places, and 4) donor_type, sorted by rounded_total_donation_amount in descending order. \n","metadata":{},"id":"32803968-253d-4647-9262-8be3fa184271","cell_type":"markdown"},{"source":"-- This query retrieves the top 5 assignment and donor type combinations with the highest total donation amounts.\n-- It joins the assignments, donations, and donors tables to aggregate donation data.\n-- The results are grouped by assignment name, donor type, and region, and ordered by the total donation amount in descending order.\n\nSELECT \n    a.assignment_name AS assignment_name,                -- Name of the assignment\n    donors.donor_type AS donor_type,                     -- Type of the donor (e.g., individual, corporate)\n    a.region AS region,                                  -- Region associated with the assignment\n    ROUND(SUM(donat.amount),2) AS rounded_total_donation_amount  -- Total donation amount (rounded to 2 decimals)\nFROM \n    public.assignments AS a\nINNER JOIN \n    public.donations AS donat\n    ON a.assignment_id = donat.assignment_id             -- Join donations to assignments by assignment_id\nINNER JOIN \n    public.donors AS donors\n    ON donat.donor_id = donors.donor_id                  -- Join donors to donations by donor_id\nGROUP BY \n    a.assignment_name, donors.donor_type, a.region       -- Group by assignment, donor type, and region\nORDER BY \n    rounded_total_donation_amount DESC                   -- Order by total donation amount, highest first\nLIMIT 5;
